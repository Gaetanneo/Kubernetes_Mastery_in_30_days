# Day 17: Pod Lifecycle


Welcome to Day 17 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll dive into the lifecycle of Kubernetes Pods.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Pod Lifecycle**: Understand the various phases and states in the lifecycle of Kubernetes Pods.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Pod Lifecycle
- Explore the [Kubernetes Pod Lifecycle documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/) to learn about the different phases Pods go through, from creation to termination.
- Understand the significance of each phase and how Pods handle failures and restarts.

### Task 2: Pod States
- Study the various states that a Pod can be in, including Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, and Unknown.
- Explore how these states affect application availability and troubleshooting.

### Task 3: Suggested Project
- Create a Pod with a simple application and experiment with different scenarios to observe the Pod's lifecycle, such as crashing the application container.
