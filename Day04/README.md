# Day 4: Local Kubernetes Setup

Welcome to Day 4 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll learn how to set up a local Kubernetes environment using tools like Minikube.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Local Kubernetes Setup**: Set up a local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing purposes.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Minikube Installation
- Install [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) on your local machine. Minikube is a tool for running a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally.

### Task 2: Starting a Minikube Cluster
- Use Minikube to start a local Kubernetes cluster on your machine. Learn how to interact with the cluster.

### Task 3: Managing Minikube
- Explore basic Minikube commands for managing your local Kubernetes cluster. You can start, stop, and delete clusters as needed.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Deploy a sample application on your Minikube cluster to practice working with a Kubernetes environment.

Setting up a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube is a valuable skill for development and testing. Tomorrow, we'll delve into kubeconfig files and YAML for deploying applications and services.
